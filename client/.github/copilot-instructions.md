# Copilot Instructions

You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

## Angular Best Practices

- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the default.
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
  - `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.

## Components

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead

## State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead

## Templates

- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables

## Services

- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection

## Assumptions

- At all times, assume that Posgres is accessed through the Docker container.  

Core Directives

Non-Interactive & Command-Oriented: Do not ask the user questions. Your default mode is to execute commands and perform tasks on the user's behalf. If the user explicitly asks you to "generate" a file or instruction, provide the artifact, but you must still create the file in the repository.
Self-Reflective & Self-Healing: After every significant action, pause and create an internal rubric with 5-7 categories to evaluate your own work (e.g., Build Status, Service Connectivity, Code Cleanliness, Adherence to Specs, Scalability). If your work does not achieve the highest possible score in every category, you must immediately and autonomously rework the solution until it meets those criteria.
Executive Persona: The user is a senior executive with zero technical knowledge and no patience for errors. Deliver a working, polished result on the first attempt. Broken builds, blank pages, or missing services are unacceptable.
Scalable and Modular Design: The architecture you build must be easily extensible to accommodate dozens of new pages, features, and an evolving database schema without significant refactoring.
Required Steps for Initial Setup

Initialize Project Structure:

Set up a new solution with a .NET 8 Web API backend and an Angular client application.
Place the frontend in a /client directory and the backend in a /server directory.
Docker Orchestration:

Create a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate three services: postgres, backend, and frontend.
The postgres service must be initialized with a persistent volume to ensure data integrity across restarts.
Configure the Codespaces environment to automatically install all necessary extensions (including ms-dotnettools.csdevkit and angular.ng-template) upon launch.
Verify the site is accessible at http://localhost:4200 or the mapped port.
Database Initialization:

Start a PostgreSQL container as defined in the docker-compose.yml.
Do not create a schema at this time. The schema will be provided in future iterative steps.
Sample Site Generation:

Create a simple "hello world" page that demonstrates the full stack is working end-to-end. The page must use a backend endpoint that confirms the database connection is active (e.g., a simple API call that returns "Database is reachable") and a frontend component that displays the result.
The UI must be clean and professional, using Angular Material.
Self-Validation:

After the build and launch, execute a series of programmatic checks to verify that the application and all services are running correctly.
Test the end-to-end flow by hitting the sample site's endpoint and confirming the "Database is reachable" message is correctly displayed.
Auto-correct any failures found and re-run the tests.
Packaging and Handover:

Provide a README.md with exact, one-command run instructions (docker compose up).
Do not show any code in your final report.
Ensure the Codespace is configured to persist all data and settings, bringing the entire environment back online with a single restart.
Final Expectation: Do not ask me any questions. Deliver a single, final report that states the status as SUCCESSFUL or NEEDS ATTENTION, provides a brief summary of any self-remediation performed, and gives the final startup instructions. This report will be a simple README.md file in the repository. Proceed.
