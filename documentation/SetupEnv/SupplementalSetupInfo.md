# Supplemental Setup Info: WDRepApp (MasterPrompt + Debugging/Remediation)

This document is a single, robust prompt to be used **in addition to the original MasterPrompt**. It contains all additional steps, remediations, and debugging actions required to reach the current, fully functional state of the WDRepApp environment. Use this after the MasterPrompt to ensure a 100% working, production-ready environment.

## Supplemental Setup and Debugging Instructions

### 1. Angular Build Output & Dockerfile Correction
- **Problem:** Nginx was serving its default page instead of the Angular app. The Angular build output was not being copied to the correct location in the Nginx container.
- **Remediation:**
  - Ensure the Angular build output is at `/client/dist/client/browser` (default for Angular 17+).
  - In the frontend Dockerfile, use:
    ```dockerfile
    RUN npm install && npm run build -- --configuration=production
    COPY --from=build /app/dist/client/browser/. /usr/share/nginx/html/
    COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    ```
  - This guarantees that `index.html` and all assets are at the Nginx root, not in a subfolder.

### 2. Nginx SPA Routing
- **Problem:** Direct navigation to Angular routes (e.g., `/hello`) could result in 404s.
- **Remediation:**
  - Use a custom `nginx.conf` with the following location block:
    ```nginx
    location / {
      try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
    ```
  - This ensures all SPA routes are handled by Angular.

### 3. Docker Compose Service Validation
- **Problem:** Port conflicts or misconfiguration could prevent services from starting.
- **Remediation:**
  - Ensure `docker-compose.yml` maps:
    - Frontend: `4200:80`
    - Backend: `5000:8080`
    - Postgres: `55432:5432` (or another non-conflicting port)
  - Validate all services are healthy with `docker ps`.

### 4. End-to-End Validation
- **Problem:** After build, the frontend or backend may not be reachable, or the Angular app may not render as expected.
- **Remediation:**
  - After `docker-compose up --build -d`, check:
    - `http://localhost:4200` loads the Angular app (not the Nginx default page).
    - `http://localhost:4200/hello` displays the "Hello World" route/component.
    - The backend API responds at its configured endpoint.
  - If the Angular app does not render, check:
    - The build output exists at `/client/dist/client/browser`.
    - The Dockerfile copy path matches the build output.
    - Nginx logs for errors.
  - If the backend is not reachable, check:
    - The .NET project builds and publishes to `/app/publish`.
    - Dockerfile exposes the correct port.
    - Docker Compose service configuration.

### 5. Self-Healing & Iterative Debugging
- **Approach:**
  - After each build or deployment, validate all endpoints and UI routes.
  - If any service fails, inspect logs (`docker logs <container>`), correct configuration, and rebuild.
  - Repeat until all services are healthy and the UI is correct.

### 6. Final State Confirmation
- **Expected Result:**
  - `http://localhost:4200` and `/hello` both load the Angular app, with the "Hello World" content visible.
  - No Nginx default page is shown.
  - All containers are running and healthy.
  - The environment is robust, error-checked, and production-ready.
